<h3 >9:40 AM - 10:40 AM</h3>
<h3 >Node.js: A Guided Tour</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#caaroncois">C. Aaron Cois</a></h4>
<p >This session is intended as an introduction to Node.js, a hot open-source technology increasingly gaining popularity within the developer community. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that enables fast, scalable, real-time network applications written in JavaScript. We'll talk about what node.js is, how it works, and its best use cases. As well as talking about node.js itself, we'll also discuss the community surrounding it, and some of the powerful modules created to enhance or simplify its capabilities, such as Express and Socket.io. Finally, we'll go through some brief code examples to show just how easy it is to leverage node.js in your projects.</p>

<h3 >Does Your Code Tell a Story?: Lessons from prose writing applied to writing code</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#halanstevens">H. Alan Stevens</a></h4>
<p >Software developers are writers. Our medium is text. What can we learn about how to write better code by studying the practices of prose authors? Frequently in software development, we solve a problem, check in the code and release it. Unfortunately, this means that we release the first draft of our solution. One of the main lessons of writing workshops and classes is to write in small chunks and revise ruthlessly. By releasing our first drafts, we increase the maintenance cost of our application by making it harder for the next developer to understand the initial intent of the our solution. In this session, we will explore concepts from the craft of writing such as small assignments, shi**y first drafts, where ideas come from and the three types of drafts as they apply to the practice of software development.</p>
<h4 >Room 2</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >Decaf Introduction to CoffeeScript</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#hectorcorrea">Hector Correa</a></h4>
<p >Come and learn about CoffeeScript, a little language that compiles into JavaScript while allowing you to write better, cleaner, and more importantly, less client code to power your web sites.

There is no doubt that JavaScript is king on the web and that frameworks (like jQuery and YUI) have taken the language to new levels. But how about language that takes JavaScript's good parts, cleans up the syntax a little bit, adds lexical scope to variables
(which prevents accidental pollution of the global namespace),  makes function binding easier, and integrates with existing JavaScript libraries?

Meet CoffeeScript, an open source language that has been around for 2+ years and provides these features.

This session is an introduction to CoffeeScript, the main features of the language, how is different from JavaScript, why is important to web developers, and how you can integrate it in your web site today.</p>
<h4 >Room 3</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >User Experience Maps for Agile Modeling</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#mariaemerson">Maria Emerson</a></h4>
<p >User Experience Maps are a lean method of modeling both observed behaviors and new interactions. They provide an accessible way for everyone on an agile team to get involved in the user experience. We will do a hands-on exercise to better understand how these maps work and talk about additional applications for everyday use.</p>
<h4 >Room 4</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >Functional Automated Testing Best Practices with Selenium WebDriver</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#benburton">Ben Burton</a></h4>
<p >This talk will be a walk-through around how to structure functional, automated tests for Selenium/WebDriver using the Page Object design pattern and Behavior Driven Design (BDD). This approach allows for testing component reusability as well as structured, readable tests. Selenium/WebDriver offers live browser testing across many different browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome... even Android and iOS Safari), so you can ensure that the functional components of your web applications work across multiple platforms and environments.

(note: I've selected all the languages I can *potentially* cover below... probably won't have time for all of them, so I'd like to select one, depending on the level of interest)</p>
<h4 >Room 5</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >Asynchronous Javascript - callbacks are so old school</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#johnkpaul">John K. Paul</a></h4>
<p >Javascript developers can't get enough of callbacks.  It's been our tried and true workhorse when dealing with asynchronous code since the dawn of ajax. With the advent of nodejs, we've taken things to the extreme. Now, if we want to make a database query, respond to a web server request, or make a rest call to a web service, we need deeply nested callbacks in order to achieve what we need. In time, this phenomenon becomes the pyramid of doom, where we need 500 character of horizontal screen width to read all of our code.

The issue here isn't that we are using asynchronous code, but rather that we aren't using the best design pattern for the job. I'd like to talk through a relatively new paradigm for control flow in javascript, the promise. Using this technique, you can develop an much more straightforward asynchronous javascript application. Not only is it a way to remove the need for callbacks, but it opens a door to new design possibilities, without the complexity of continuation passing style. Rather than passing all of our callbacks as arguments, we will take a higher level, and more functional approach, by creating a system that expects promise objects to eventually produce data, and we manipulate that data expecting that it will exist in the future.

//notes
This talk can be targeted at either nodejs, or jQuery, or a hybrid of both. jQuery has a slightly different and non standard implementation of promises, but I could easily cover both and smooth over the differences. For me, it just depends on what people are predominantly interested in.</p>

<h3 >Building JVM Compilers with JRuby</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#christopherumbel">Christopher Umbel</a></h4>
<p >These were the main developer pains that lead to the development of ql.io, an open source querying system built on top of Node.js. Using a SQL and JSON based language to declare API calls, interdependencies, forks and joins, filtering and projections, app developers are able to cut down the amount of effort required to integrate multiple APIs from hundreds of lines of code down to a few. Besides the language itself, ql.io can be deployed as a stand-alone server, allowing you to deploy it as an HTTP gateway between client apps and API servers to have ql.io process and condense the data to just the fields that the client needs.</p>
<h4 >Room 9</h4>

<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#kendallmiller">Kendall Miller</a></h4>
<p >In this talk we will explore the underpinnings of ql.io and how Node.js powers this next generation system. We will look into how to query multiple HTTP API data sources simply and efficiently, and explore how the service can be deployed on your own systems to handle raw mashups of your own and external data, all while decreasing overall bandwidth usage, network roundtrips, and increasing product reliability.</p>
<h4 >Room 2</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >Backbone.js with CoffeeScript or 'Wow, client side coding no longer sucks'</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#lensmith">Len Smith</a></h4>
<p >What would it look like if we could use a better language to develop client side applications along with a mature framework to do so?

It would look like writing applications in CoffeeScript and Backbone.js.

Come to this session for some CoffeeScript and Backbone basics, and you just might not dread your next adventure into client side programming

<h3 >Exploring UX techniques and practices - When should they be applied?</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#ariadnafont">Ariadna Font</a></h4>
<p >The need to incorporate UX into Agile is quickly becoming a no-brainer. But how do experts do it? Let's find out so that you can do it too!<br/>
In this collaborative design session, I will start by using human-centered design methods to elicit lean UX practices and techniques from the participants, and then categorize them by product development stage. The result is a poster with a clear picture of what UX practices and techniques are appropriate and useful at what stages of a product life cycle. <br/>
Come to this session to:<br/>
    find out the newest lean UX techniques<br/>
    enlighten us with your new favorite UX technique(s)

<h3 >Agile is NOT a 4 Letter Word or How I Got My Boss Over the Waterfall and Into the 21st Century</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#benjaminbykowski">Benjamin Bykowski</a></h4>
<p >Few topics have garnered more scorn and skepticism from the top-level executives of software or Web development companies than agile. Whether at a dev shop, agency, or company, large or small, selling agile development to The Man is often a daunting task. Have no fear! In this discussion you will learn all the tips, tricks and techniques needed to help your boss see why agile methodologies and practices not only make the design and development teams better and happier (read: more efficient), but how they can save time and money (read: add to the bottom line). Using the language of the business owner,  we will cover both new and familiar topics including agile estimation, creating and using an inception deck, user stories, iteration planning and the burn-down chart, agile communication, business driven development, and visual workspaces. As a bonus we will share ideas for paying down your technical debt, setting up continuous integration, and how to develop an agile ROI model based on the real-life work of area software professionals. Best of all, you'll learn how to show and not just tell The Brass these concepts without ever using the word agile. Sound good? Great, we'll see you there! </p>
<h4 >Room 5</h4>

<h4 >Room 7</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >Getting Started with SignalR</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#richdudley">Rich Dudley</a></h4>
<p >SignalR is an asynchronous signaling library for ASP.NET. It's designed to help you build real-time web applications without a lot of hassle  In the past, developers would have to wire up "real-time" applications as a series of polls to a webserver, waiting for it to receive data back that was useful. This approach usually cost more in bandwidth than we wanted it to. SignalR simplifies this process, and makes it more useful for the web developer.  Although the server portion is .NET, the client is pure JavaScript, and can easily be incorporated into a web application of any flavor.  In this presentation, Rich will guide you through implementing SignalR into your applications, and how you can take advantage of everything it has to offer. </p>
<h4 >Room 8</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >Constructing a Next Generation Open Source Web Querying System with Node.js and ql.io</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#jonathanleblanc">Jonathan LeBlanc</a></h4>
<p >In most modern web and mobile applications, much of the raw data source backbone comes from the mashing up of HTTP based APIs from multiple sites and services, both internally and externally. These sources are used for everything from localization to personalization and product querying. As more services are added to provide this functionality, the number of network roundtrips increases along with bandwidth consumption, and due to interdependency problems and inconsistent APIs, product reliability suffers.</p>
<h4 >Room 9</h4>

<h3 >Backbone.js and JS Frameworks</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#jonkoynok">Jon Koynok</a></h4>
<p >Do your more advanced UI's consists of long lists of event wireups in document.ready?  If so, you've probably already realized the need for a standardized javascipt framework to solve this issue.  There are quite a few out there.  I'll intro Backbone.js and it's place relative to similar frameworks such as Knockout.js.  The talk will then follow up with a quick demo of how backbone facilitates client-side 2-way data binding.  The demo will be platform-agnostic and will be conducted in either rails or asp.net mvc.

<h3 >Inspecting MongoDB without Crashing It</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#chadwhitacre">Chad Whitacre</a></h4>
<p >MongoDB is one of the leading NoSQL databases on the market. It's very developer-friendly, though it can cause head-aches at scale. I wrote a web-based data browser for MongoDB called Mongs. The first part of the talk will introduce the features of Mongs. Then I'll share some examples of how you can crash a MongoDB server using the standard inspection and monitoring tools, and I'll explain how Mongs protects you from this.</p>

<h3 >Agile Continuous Delivery</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#adamkalnas">Adam Kalnas</a></h4>
<p >You think your team is agile?  Ever been in a situation where your team needs to deliver a critical fix to your customers ASAP?  Yeah, me too.  Even if the code fix only one line long, what is the shortest amount of time you could possibly get that fix to a customer? 

Continuous Delivery is focused on automating processes so your team can release software to customers frequently.  Many development teams have great agile principles and processes in place for creating software.  The challenge still remains in "the last mile" and getting the software in the hands of your customers.</p>

<h3 >You say Tomato, I say Pomodoro</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#joelcochran">Joel Cochran</a></h4>
<p >Do you have trouble getting things done at work? Constantly interrupted by your boss, coworkers, and friends? Do you sidetrack yourself with email, Facebook, and Twitter? Do you work all day but feel you don't accomplish anything? Do you fight procrastination? Are you great at starting projects but terrible at finishing them? Are you depressed yet from reading this abstract? If you answered "No" to every question it means you're lying to yourself. If you said "Yes" to any (or all!) of them, it means you're human! Have no fear, Pomodoro is here! Pomodoro is a time and task management technique that can help you become more productive than you ever imagined. In this session we'll discuss all of the problems listed above and introduce the basics of Pomodoro Time Management. We'll also delve into the practical issues of dealing with distractions and context switching. There is something here for everyone so come join in the conversation!</p>

<h3 >Javascript - Only Three Bad Parts</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#johnkpaul">John K. Paul</a></h4>
<p >Douglas Crockford's book "Javascript: The Good Parts," is one of the best selling javascript books of all time and is only 176 pages long.  For most developers,  there's an tacit belief that the rest of Javascript falls under "bad."  There are websites dedicated to these list of language mis-features and anti-patterns, and dozens of blog posts about how to avoid the "bad" in your own code.

I don't think that these most of these things are actually "bad". In their day to day, developers don't need to worry about all of these smaller issues .Chances are, a javascript developer has encountered these difficult issues, learned the solution, and then immediately absorbed the concepts.

I'm going to explain to you, the real three "bad" parts of the language. These are the three javascript specific features that are the most likely to trip up a javascript developer.  Once you innately understand these three issues, you will become significantly more productive in javascript, and will be a lot less confused when reading through large javascript code bases.

I'll be walking you through three concepts within javascript semantics:
1) What on earth does "this" mean?
2) How does prototypical inheritance work?
3) What's the difference between a function expression and function declaration, and why do I care?</p>

<h3 >The stuff around agile</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#drcharles(chuck)suscheck">Dr. Charles (Chuck) Suscheck</a></h4>
<p >There are a lot of presentations about Scrum, XP, Lean, and generally team based agile, but there's more to agile than just a team.  There's a lot of other agile related 'stuff' that needs to be addressed from a management and business side.

This presentation is going to assume you know enough about Scrum or XP to practice it at a team level, but now your ready to have a go at the project or program level.  What do you need to know.

What's vertical story slicing and why is it important?
How do you create the product backlog and track features?  
What do you need to make a good portfolio?
What about (gasp) agile metrics, ROI, and earned value?
What should your PMO really try to avoid?
What about support?

If you're ready for the next level of agile - from a business and management side - this is the session you should take.  If you're looking for a technical talk - this is not the session.

<h3 >MoCloud : Useful Cloud Patterns for Mobile Developers</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#danilodiaz">Danilo Diaz</a></h4>
<p >If you want to spicy up a resume with the latest tech scene buzz words, I can't think of two better ones than "mobility" and "cloud". We all know that both of these technologies will play a big role in the future of our industry. In this session, I will outline several popular design patterns for building powerful and scalable mobile applications. While all of the patterns shown are "cloud provider"
independent, I will concentrate on Windows Azure using Windows Phone as the mobile client.

<h3 >Getting Started with MongoDB and .NET</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#jeremyjarrell">Jeremy Jarrell</a></h4>
<p >Have you heard the buzz about NoSQL but don't know where to start?

This session will give you the tools to get started with MongoDB--one of the most popular NoSQL databases--on the .NET platform.  

We'll cover downloading the right drivers and distribution, installing the server as a Windows Service, and working with MongoDB from your .NET application.

Soup to nuts, at the end of this session you'll not only understand the basics of MongoDB but will know what types of problems it can solve in your environment.</p>

<h3 >Continuous Testing in .NET</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#joelmason">Joel Mason</a></h4>
<p >Continuous Testing, the idea that unit tests are run on every save, once was only a dream.  In recent years this idea has become a reality in Java and Ruby first, but in .NET shortly after.  In this presentation we will look at the fundamentals and driving forces of Continuous Testing.  We will also look at four tools (AutoTest.NET, Continuous Tests, NCrunch and Visual Studio 11) and see how each of them attempt to solve the problem of continuously running tests in .NET.  </p>
<h4 >Room 8</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >3:15 PM - 4:30 PM</h3>
<h3 >Hypermedia API Design</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#steveklabnik">Steve Klabnik</a></h4>
<p >Rails did a lot to bring REST to developers, but its conception leaves the REST devotee feeling a bit empty. "Where's the hypermedia?" she says. "REST isn't RPC," he may cry. "WTF??!?!" you may think. "I have it right there! resources :posts ! What more is there? RPC? Huh?"

In this talk, Steve will explain how to design your APIs so that they truly embrace the web and HTTP. Just as there's an impedance mismatch between our databases, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch between our applications, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will be discussed, as well as why we aren't building things this way yet.</p>

<h3 >Going for Speed: Testing for Performance</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#jayharris">Jay Harris</a></h4>
<p >Unit Testing has settled into the mainstream. As developers, we write code that checks code, ensuring that the outcome matches some expected result. But, are we really? As end-users (which includes each one of us from time to time), when we ask a question, we don't just expect our answer to be right, we expect it to be right now. So as developers, why are we only validating for accuracy? Why aren't we going for speed? During this session we'll discuss meeting the performance needs of an application, including developing a performance specification, measuring application performance from stand-alone testing through unit testing, using tools ranging from Team Foundation Server to the command line, and asserting on these measurements to ensure that all expectations are met. Your application does "right." Let's focus on "right now."</p>

<h3 >How to write a technical book</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#joelcochran">Joel Cochran</a></h4>
<p >With technology moving at such a rapid pace the demand for quality, up-to-date content is higher than ever. Books are still key players in this field, but writing a technical book is a daunting task. In this interactive session we will discuss the ins and outs of technical publishing, from selling your idea to a publisher, to contracts, content organization, the writing process, technical editing, and much more. If you've ever had the urge to write a technical book, this session is for you!</p>

<h3 >.NET Integration with WebSphere</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#adrianwrightandglenwirth">Adrian Wright and Glen Wirth</a></h4>
<p >What?  WebSphere integrates with .NET?  We'll take a look new features of WebSphere Message Broker and WebSphere MQ that allow for direct .NET integration.  Message Broker's .NET Compute Nodes are a powerful extension point that allow extensibility using any .NET language.  This is a great feature for .NET shops looking to integrate on the enterprise level.  We'll also look at the WCF channel for MQ, a custom channel that allows .NET developers to leverage the power of WCF with Websphere MQ.  Instead of adding a middle-man to translate between MSMQ and MQ, use the WCF channel to write directly to MQ.</p>
<h4 >Room 7</h4>
<hr/>
<h3 >JavaScript Testing</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#johnvpetersen">John V. Petersen</a></h4>
<p >One of the most important tasks in software development is having automated unit tests. For code to be unit testable, it means that your code adheres to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Dependency Inversion, etc). Often, JavaScript is cluttered and disorganized, and therefore, is not testable. In this session, John will cover, through practical examples, how to write solid and testable code. John will also cover some practical examples of how to re-factor JavaScript code that is not unit testable into a foundation that is unit testable - and thus is more maintainable. </p>

<h3 >What's New in Team Foundation Server 11</h3>
<h4 ><a href="Speakers.html#brianminisi">Brian Minisi</a></h4>
<p >Team Foundation Server (TFS) is an enterprise tool for managing your application lifecycle from requirements through code design, implementation, testing and deployment.  The ability to trace requirements, tasks, defects, and test cases to checked-in code improves tracking to more quickly and reliably deliver projects.

The next version of TFS improves upon the experience of creating a product backlog, planning an iteration, and tracking the progress of a Sprint.  This session will walk through a lifecycle using the Agile methodology to demonstrate many of the features available in the next version of Visual Studio and TFS.  This includes the new Team Explorer, Capacity Planning, Boards, Storyboards, Source Control, and an overview of testing using the Microsoft Test Manager tool.
