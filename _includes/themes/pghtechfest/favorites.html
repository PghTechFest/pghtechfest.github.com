This approach allows for testing component reusability as well as structured, readable tests. Selenium\/WebDriver offers live browser testing across many different browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome... even Android and iOS Safari), so you can ensure that the functional components of your web applications work across multiple platforms and environments.\r\n\r\n(note: I've selected all the languages I can *potentially* cover below... probably won't have time for all of them, so I'd like to select one, depending on the level of interest)","presenters_name":"Ben Burton","presenters_bio":"I'm a New York City based software engineer with interests in many different languages. Professionally I regularly use Scala, Java, and Javascript. In my free time I've been teaching myself Python and working with a Django + MongoDB stack.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in a wide variety of web frameworks, both front and backend.

It's been our tried and true workhorse when dealing with asynchronous code since the dawn of ajax. With the advent of nodejs, we've taken things to the extreme. Now, if we want to make a database query, respond to a web server request, or make a rest call to a web service, we need deeply nested callbacks in order to achieve what we need. In time, this phenomenon becomes the pyramid of doom, where we need 500 character of horizontal screen width to read all of our code.\r\rThe issue here isn't that we are using asynchronous code, but rather that we aren't using the best design pattern for the job. I'd like to talk through a relatively new paradigm for control flow in javascript, the promise. Using this technique, you can develop an much more straightforward asynchronous javascript application. Not only is it a way to remove the need for callbacks, but it opens a door to new design possibilities, without the complexity of continuation passing style. Rather than passing all of our callbacks as arguments, we will take a higher level, and more functional approach, by creating a system that expects promise objects to eventually produce data, and we manipulate that data expecting that it will exist in the future.","presenters_name":"John K.

Our medium is text. What can we learn about how to write better code by studying the practices of prose authors? Frequently in software development, we solve a problem, check in the code and release it. Unfortunately, this means that we release the first draft of our solution. One of the main lessons of writing workshops and classes is to write in small chunks and revise ruthlessly. By releasing our first drafts, we increase the maintenance cost of our application by making it harder for the next developer to understand the initial intent of the our solution. In this session, we will explore concepts from the craft of writing such as small assignments, shi**y first drafts, where ideas come from and the three types of drafts as they apply to the practice of software development.","presenters_name":"H.
